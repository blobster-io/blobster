*******************************************************************************************
* EXTREME IMPORTANT WARNING - YOU CAN HURT YOUR BLOBSTER OR PRINTER WHEN NOT RESPECTED!!! *
*******************************************************************************************

Before you'll mount your servos to Blobster and turn it on for the first time and before you'll run the GCODE script provided for the first time on your printer just ask me for assistence. There's a not yet documented routine which is necessary to follow at the beginning to calibrate everything for your Blobster and printer. There are several hardoded parameters in Arduino code which should be carefully changed for your setup, I'll guide you through. We should change this ASAP but it is as it is for now.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! ;-)
